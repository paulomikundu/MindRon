🔹 Overview

MINDRON is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that analyzes short stories through three core functionalities:

Genre Classification – Determines the most relevant literary genre using a zero-shot classifier.

Summarization – Generates a concise summary based on user-defined length constraints.

Emotion Detection – Identifies the dominant emotion in the story’s summary.

MINDRON leverages state-of-the-art Transformer-based Deep Learning models to provide highly accurate predictions and analysis.
